# Polymorphic Engines

## What is it?

As a malware author, you know your code is flagged because it is constant once you release it, leading to it getting caught by all the AV companies when it is detected. So the smart malware authors made malware that changed itself using very complex code. Each time it spread, it would be completely different or slightly different, so no antivirus can catch it. 

## How to defend?

To work against this new menace, the Anti-virus companies made a solution. They would not only read the code for patterns. Actions speak louder than words do, so companies started to monitor actions of the running programs for bad behavior, leading to the complex Anti-Virus services you see today.
