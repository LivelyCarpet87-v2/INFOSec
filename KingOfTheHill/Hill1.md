# Teams

It is highly recommended to form teams (up to 4 people, with officer discretion for approval) to solve challenges as you may take turns maintaining your teams position and help each other research. Officers must add you to the game before you can play. 

# How to Play

To become the new king, you need to solve the cryptography challenge and get the flag. The ciphertext and cipher type are displayed on the site. The flag is preceded by randomly selected (from a pool) buffer text.  By submitting the flag, the current king will be overthrown and your team will reign as king, hopefully for a long time. As kings take over, a new challenge is randomly generated. The ruling king cannot solve the challenge to renew it, but others can to overthrow the ruling king by solving the challenge.
