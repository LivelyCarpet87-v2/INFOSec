The Week 3 hill can currently be found at `sasinfosec.ngrok.io`.

# Teams

It is highly recommended to form teams (up to 4 people, with officer discretion for approval) to attack as you may take turns maintaining your teams position and help each other research. Officers must add you to the game before you can play.

# How to Play

To become the new king, you bypass the admin page login using SQL injection. The filters and debug output are displayed on the site. By bypassing the login, the current king will be overthrown and your team will reign as king, hopefully for a long time. As kings take over, their previous attack is displayed to the new king. The ruling king improve the filters to defend his or her position.

Unlike the previous game, there is more than 1 hill and each type of hill give different amounts of points. There are more mechanics explained in the game info pages.
