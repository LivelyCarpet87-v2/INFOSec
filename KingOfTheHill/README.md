# King of the Hill

## Basics

King of the Hill has preconfigured machines, which require all teams to exploit. Once your team has successfully taken over the machine, the focus shifts to defending the machine from other teams attacks. Score is usually determined by a score reporting service on the machine, that reports a team token. When one team is able to gain access, they will remove the other teams token, and insert their own, thus making them the King of the Hill.
