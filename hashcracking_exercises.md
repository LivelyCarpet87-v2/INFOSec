# Easy (should be solvable using the tutorial alone)

Sally forgot her password to her computer but surprisingly has the hash of the password. Sally's computer also surprisingly uses md5 unsalted hashes. 
It is surprising she hasn't been hacked yet! Her hash is "". She works at a company called WideOpen, specializing in giving people bad
security solutions for high prices. She has a cat called MCFluffers. She was born on Dec 23, 1968. She is unmarried and loves hockey. She does not know leet. 
Your goal is to crack Sally's password for her. 

# Medium (a little reading of the man page and extra readings can't hurt)

## Exercise 1

Larry forgot his password to his computer but surprisingly has the hash of the password. Larry's computer also surprisingly uses SHA2-512 hashes. 
It is surprising he hasn't been hacked yet! Maybe he has a strong password? His hash is "". He works at a company called NotWideOpen, specializing in giving people mediocre
security solutions. He has a turtle called Speedy. He was born on Feb 23, 1949. He is married to Tina and loves boxing. He uses leet way too much. 
Your goal is to crack Larry's password for him. 

## Exercise 2

Johhny Appleseed, an imaginary INFOSec member, stored the hash of a flag that holds the key to a reward. The flag was INFOSec{xxx}, with the each "x" denoting a random character (eg INFOSec{tom}). 
Find the flag encoded into this hash "74a26b2ab557df3b2bcd22b86f1d0813". Here is a useful tool: https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/ 

You might want to read the bits on the man page or our guide links for brute force without wordlists and masking.
